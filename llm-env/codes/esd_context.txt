A learner-centred approach
 Learner-centred pedagogy sees students as autonomous 
learners and emphasizes the active development of 
knowledge rather than its mere transfer and/or passive 
learning experiences. The learners’ prior knowledge as well 
as their experiences in the social context are the starting 
points for stimulating learning processes in which the 
learners construct their own knowledge base. Learner
centred approaches require learners to reflect on their own 
knowledge and learning processes in order to manage and 
monitor them. Educators should stimulate and support 
those reflections. Learner-centred approaches change the 
role of an educator to one of being a facilitator of learning 
processes (instead of being an expert who only transfers 
structured knowledge) (Barth, 2015).
 Action-oriented learning
 In action-oriented learning, learners engage in action 
and reflect on their experiences in terms of the 
intended learning process and personal development. 
The experience might come from a project (in-service 
learning), an internship, the facilitation of a workshop, 
the implementation of a campaign, etc. Action-learning 
refers to Kolb’s theory of the experiential learning 
cycle with the following stages: 1. Having a concrete 
experience, 2. Observing and reflecting, 3. Forming 
abstract concepts for generalization and 4. Applying them 
in new situations. Action-learning increases 
knowledge acquisition, competency development and 
values clarification by linking abstract concepts to personal 
experience and the learner’s life. The role of the educator 
is to create a learning environment that prompts learners’ 
experiences and reflexive thought processes.
 Transformative learning
 Transformative learning can best be defined by its aims 
and principles, rather than by any concrete teaching 
or learning strategy. It aims at empowering learners to 
question and change the ways they see and think about the 
world in order to deepen their understanding of it. The educator is a 
facilitator who empowers and challenges learners to alter 
their worldviews. The related concept of transgressive 
learning goes one step further: It 
underlines that learning in ESD has to overcome the status 
quo and prepare the learner for disruptive thinking and the 
co-creation of new knowledge
