{"source_file": "3J. Core CE7J06.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7J06 aligns with any of the provided SDGs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 1: No Poverty. The module is about wave energy and engineering. I don't see anything directly related to poverty reduction or empowerment here. The learning objectives focus on technical aspects like wave equations and device analysis. There's no mention of social issues or poverty, so probably no alignment.\n\nNext, SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Again, the module is centered around engineering and technology. While sustainable agriculture is part of SDG 2, the module doesn't touch on food security or nutrition. It's more about energy systems, so likely no connection here either.\n\nMoving on to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. The module does talk about the environmental aspects of wave power, but it's more about the technology itself rather than health outcomes. There's nothing about diseases, mental health, or well-being initiatives, so probably no embedding here.\n\nLastly, SDG 4: Quality Education. This one might have some relevance because the module involves education and skill development. The module aims to enhance problem-solving and communication skills, which are part of quality education. Also, the graduate attributes mention critical thinking and effective communication, which ties into education for sustainable development. So, there's definitely some embedding here, maybe partial since it's more about engineering skills than broader education goals.\n\nSo, putting it all together, only SDG 4 seems to have partial embedding, while the others don't align at all."}
{"source_file": "3J. Core CE7J06.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7J06 aligns with any of the provided SDGs: 5, 6, 7, or 8. Let me go through each SDG one by one.\n\nStarting with SDG 5: Gender Equality. Looking at the module content, it's mainly about wave energy, hydrodynamics, and engineering applications. The learning objectives focus on technical skills like assessing wave energy and designing systems. There's nothing mentioned about gender issues, equality, or empowerment. So, no direct link here. Maybe the graduate attributes mention acting responsibly and communicating effectively, but these are general skills, not specific to gender equality. So, I don't see any of the 15 objectives for SDG 5 being met. Embedding Status would be No, with a rating of 0.\n\nMoving on to SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The module deals with wave and ocean energy, which does relate to water resources. However, the content focuses more on the technical aspects like hydrodynamics and power equipment rather than water quality, pollution, or sanitation. While wave energy could theoretically contribute to clean water by providing renewable energy, the module doesn't explicitly cover water management or sanitation. So, maybe there's a slight connection, but none of the specific learning objectives match. It might get a limited reference, so Embedding Status Yes with a rating of 1.\n\nNext, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. This seems more relevant since the module is about renewable energy sources like wave and tidal energy. The learning objectives include calculating resource potential and designing power systems, which ties into providing clean energy. Several of the module's LOs like LO7 and LO8 directly relate to assessing and calculating energy outputs, which supports SDG 7's goals. More than two objectives are covered, so Embedding Status is Yes with a higher rating, maybe 2 or 3. Given the strong focus on renewable energy, I'd say rating 3 for full embeddedness.\n\nLastly, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The module doesn't touch on employment, labor rights, or economic growth directly. It's more about engineering skills and problem-solving. So, no specific alignment here. Embedding Status is No with a rating of 0.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- SDG 5: No embedding.\n- SDG 6: Limited reference.\n- SDG 7: Fully embedded.\n- SDG 8: No evidence."}
{"source_file": "3J. Core CE7J06.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7J06 aligns with the provided SDGs. Let me start by looking at each SDG one by one.\n\nFirst up is SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The module focuses on wave energy, which is a form of renewable energy. This seems relevant because sustainable infrastructure is part of SDG 9. Looking at the learning objectives, LO9 mentions the social and environmental aspects of wave power, which ties into sustainable infrastructure. Also, the graduate attributes like acting responsibly and communicating effectively might support innovation in the industry. So, I think SDG 9 is partially embedded here.\n\nNext is SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. The module doesn't seem to directly address inequality. It's more about engineering and technology without specific mention of reducing inequalities. So, maybe no embedding here.\n\nThen SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The module deals with wave energy, which could contribute to sustainable energy solutions for cities. However, the module doesn't explicitly cover city planning or community sustainability beyond energy. So, perhaps limited embedding.\n\nLastly, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The module teaches about sustainable energy production, which relates to responsible production practices. LO9 again touches on environmental impacts, so there's some alignment here. But it's not deeply integrated throughout the module.\n\nSo, summarizing: SDG 9 and 12 have partial embedding, SDG 11 has limited, and SDG 10 none."}
{"source_file": "3J. Core CE7J06.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the module \"Wave Energy\" aligns with the provided SDGs. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at SDG 13: Climate Action. The module covers wave energy, which is a renewable energy source. That seems relevant because renewable energy helps reduce greenhouse gases. In the module, there's a learning objective (LO9) that mentions the social and environmental aspects of wave power systems. Also, the graduate attributes include responsible action and independent thinking, which ties into addressing climate issues. So, I think two learning objectives here are met, so EmbeddingStatus is Yes and maybe a rating of 2 since it's partially embedded.\n\nNext, SDG 14: Life Below Water. The module is all about ocean energy, which directly relates to marine resources. Several LOs like LO4, LO5, LO6, LO7, LO8, and LO9 deal with analyzing devices and systems in the ocean. Plus, the assessment includes course work that touches on these topics. This seems pretty comprehensive, covering multiple objectives, so EmbeddingStatus is Yes with a high rating, maybe 3.\n\nNow, SDG 15: Life on Land. The module doesn't mention anything about terrestrial ecosystems or biodiversity on land. It focuses solely on marine environments. So, there's no direct link here. Thus, EmbeddingStatus is No with a rating of 0.\n\nMoving on to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The module doesn't cover any content related to justice or peace. It's purely technical, so no connection here. Hence, EmbeddingStatus is No, rating 0.\n\nLastly, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. The module involves group projects and communication skills, which might tie into partnerships. However, it's more about individual student projects rather than global collaborations. So, while there's some relevance, it's limited.Therefore, EmbeddingStatus is Yes but with a lower rating, maybe 1.\n\nPutting it all together, each SDG has varying levels of embedding in the module."}

The module integrates multiple areas like theory, software, and real data, which fits this competency. Directly referenced, so embedding rating is 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each competency is addressed to varying degrees, ensuring a comprehensive approach to sustainability education."}
{"source_file": "3J. Core CE7J06.pdf", "section": "Pedagogy", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the pedagogical approaches mentioned in the module CE7J06: J6: Wave Energy. Let me go through each approach one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at Learner-Centred Approach. The module talks about fostering problem-solving and critical thinking by applying theory to real-life projects. That sounds like students are actively constructing their own knowledge, which aligns with learner-centered methods. So, yes, there's a direct reference here. Now, how embedded is this? The module uses assignments and projects, which are hands-on, so I'd say it's fully embedded, rating 3.\n\nNext, Action-Oriented Learning. The module mentions students engaging in discussions and working on real-world projects. This seems similar to action learning where students apply what they've learned. There's a clear link here, so direct reference. As for embedding, since it's part of the assessments and projects, it's quite integrated. Maybe a 3 again because it's central to the module's activities.\n\nLastly, Transformative Learning. The module doesn't explicitly mention changing worldviews or empowering students to question existing norms. It focuses more on technical aspects. So, no direct reference here. Therefore, embedding rating would be 0.\n\nSo, summarizing: Learner-Centred and Action-OrientED are both present and highly embedded, while Transformative isn't really part of this module."}
