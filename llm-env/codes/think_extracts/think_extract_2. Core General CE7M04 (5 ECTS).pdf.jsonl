{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7M04 aligns with the SDGs provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 1: No Poverty. The module talks about sustainability in engineering and mentions things like life cycle assessments and circular economy. But does it directly relate to ending poverty?Hmm, maybe indirectly because sustainable practices could lead to better resource distribution. But the module doesn't explicitly mention poverty reduction strategies or empowerment of communities. So maybe there's limited reference here.\n\nNext, SDG 2: Zero Hunger. The module focuses on engineering projects and sustainability but doesn't specifically address hunger or food security. It might touch on sustainable agriculture through LCA, but again, it's not explicit. So probably no direct embedding here either.\n\nThen, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. The module includes critical appraisals and report writing, which could relate to health topics. But nothing in the content directly ties to health promotion or disease prevention. So likely no embedding here too.\n\nLastly, SDG 4: Quality Education. The module supports student research development and uses participatory methods. This seems to align well with providing education opportunities. They have assignments and reports which are part of learning processes. So this one definitely embeds SDG 4.\n\nSo overall, only SDG 4 is clearly embedded, while the others have minimal or no connection."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the module M4: Engineering Project aligns with four specific SDGs: 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let me go through each SDG one by one.\n\nStarting with SDG 5: Gender Equality. Looking at the module content, I don't see any direct mention of gender-related topics. The learning objectives focus more on sustainability in engineering, research methods, and LCA. So, maybe no explicit connection here. But wait, LO1 talks about appraising tools for sustainability, which could indirectly touch on gender equality if considering diverse teams. However, none of the module's content specifically addresses gender issues or objectives listed under SDG5. So probably no embedding here.\n\nNext, SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The module does cover sustainability, which includes water management. There's mention of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and circular economy, which relates to resource management. Also, students do a report on LCA, which might involve water usage. So, there's a partial embedding here since water is part of sustainability, but it's not the main focus. Maybe a rating of 2?\n\nMoving on to SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy. The module emphasizes sustainability and using LCA, which ties into energy efficiency. Students learn about sustainable practices and report on LCA, which can relate to energy systems. So, there's a clear link here, perhaps a rating of 2 or even 3? Wait, looking closer, the module doesn't explicitly mention energy resources or renewable energy, so maybe just partial embedding. Hmm, maybe a 2.\n\nLastly, SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The module supports research and project development, which can tie into economic growth. However, the content doesn't directly address employment or labor rights. It's more about academic research than workplace issues. So, probably no embedding here.\n\nSo, summarizing: SDG5 - No, SDG6 - Partial (rating 2), SDG7 - Partial (rating 2), SDG8 - No."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7M04 aligns with the four provided SDGs: 9, 10, 11, and 12. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The module talks about sustainability in engineering practice, research methods, and has a specific mention of \"sustainability perspectives within engineering practice.\" That seems relevant because SDG 9 is about sustainable industrialization and infrastructure. The learning objectives include appraising tools for sustainability and applying ISO standards for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which directly ties into sustainable practices. So, at least two of SDG 9's objectives are covered here. I'd say it's partially embedded, maybe a rating of 2.\n\nNext, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. The module doesn't explicitly mention anything about inequality, social justice, or reducing disparities. It focuses more on technical aspects like research methods and LCA. Since there's no direct link to addressing inequalities, I don't see any alignment here. So, Embedding Status would be No, with a rating of 0.\n\nMoving on to SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The module does discuss sustainability and resilience, which relates to making cities and communities sustainable. However, it's more about general sustainability rather than specific city planning or community aspects. There might be some indirect links, but nothing explicit. Maybe limited references, so a rating of 1.\n\nLastly, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The module covers life cycle assessments and sustainable practices, which are central to responsible production and consumption. The focus on LCA and circular economy (CE) directly supports SDG 12. At least two objectives are met here, so it's fully embedded with a rating of 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the module aligns well with SDG 9 and 12, less so with SDG 11, and not at all with SDG 10."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the module CE7M04 aligns with the given SDGs. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each SDG one by one and see if the module covers at least two learning objectives for that SDG. If it does, then the module embeds that SDG, otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nStarting with SDG 13: Climate Action. The module talks about sustainability perspectives in engineering and has a specific mention of life cycle assessments. Looking at the learning objectives for SDG 13, I notice LO1 and LO4 of the module both touch on sustainability and using ISO standards for LCA, which directly relates to climate action. So, SDG 13 seems to be embedded here.\n\nNext, SDG 14: Life Below Water. The module includes content on sustainability in engineering but doesn't specifically mention marine resources or ocean conservation. None of the learning objectives for SDG 14 are clearly addressed, so I don't think it's embedded.\n\nMoving on to SDG 15: Life on Land. Again, the module covers sustainability and mentions things like combating desertification, which ties into land degradation. The learning objectives here might relate since the module supports sustainable practices, but without explicit mention of biodiversity or forest management, it's a bit vague. Maybe partial embedding.\n\nThen, SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The module doesn't seem to cover any content related to justice, peace, or institutional strength. So, no embedding here.\n\nLastly, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. The module emphasizes research collaboration and global partnerships, especially in engineering projects. This aligns with the idea of multi-stakeholder partnerships, so there's definitely some embedding here.\n\nSo, summarizing: SDG 13 is fully embedded, SDG 15 partially, and SDG 17 partially. The others don't have enough coverage."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Competencies", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to evaluate how well the CE7M04 module aligns with eight specific competencies. Let me start by understanding what each competency entails and then see how the module content matches up.\n\nFirst, Systems Thinking. The module talks about research methods, data analysis, and sustainability. It mentions things like systems in the context of engineering projects, especially when discussing LCA and circular economy. That seems directly related because it's about understanding how systems interact and affect each other, which is core to systems thinking. So I'd say direct reference here, and since it's a significant part of the content, maybe a 3 for embedding.\n\nNext, Anticipatory Competency. This involves looking into the future and assessing possible outcomes. The module includes sustainability perspectives and developing beyond state-of-the-art research. It also touches on applying ISO standards which have future implications. So yes, there are direct references, and the focus on future applications would give it a high embedding rating, probably a 3.\n\nNormative Competency is about understanding and reflecting on values and norms. The module objectives mention appraising tools for sustainability and explaining engineering contributions, which implies dealing with underlying values. There's direct mention of sustainability values, so direct reference yes. Since it's integrated throughout the module, embedding rating might be a 3.\n\nStrategic Competency focuses on collective innovation for sustainability. The module supports developing research projects and applies ISO standards, which are strategic for sustainability. Direct references exist, especially in the learning objectives, so embedding rating could be a 3.\n\nCollaboration Competency involves working with others and empathy. The module has group work in assessments like literature reviews and presentations, which require collaboration. So direct references are present, but maybe not as emphasized as others. Maybe a 2 for embedding.\n\nCritical Thinking is about questioning norms and practices. The module requires critical appraisals and analyses, which fit here. Direct references are clear, and since it's a major part of assessments, embedding rating is likely a 3.\n\nSelf-AwareNESS involves reflection on one's role. The module doesn't explicitly mention personal reflection, but through developing a critical outlook and supporting research, there might be some indirect references. So embedding rating would be lower, maybe a 1.\n\nIntegrated Problem-Solving requires combining approaches for complex issues. The module covers various methods and tools, suggesting an integrated approach. Direct references are present, especially in handling complex sustainability problems, so embedding rating is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each competency has varying levels of presence and emphasis in the module."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M04 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Pedagogy", "think_content": "Alright, let's break down how I arrived at these ratings for each pedagogical approach in the module.\n\nStarting with **Learner-Centred Approach**: The module content emphasizes student autonomy and active knowledge construction, which aligns perfectly with this approach. The assessments like critical appraisals and reports require students to apply their own knowledge, so I rated it a 3.\n\nNext, **Action-Oriented Learning**: The module includes practical tasks such as LCA assignments and real-world applications, fitting Kolb's experiential cycle. These elements show a strong integration, hence a 3 rating.\n\nLastly, **Transformative Learning**: While the module mentions critical appraisals and changing perspectives, it doesn't explicitly use terms like 'empowering' or 'disruptive thinking.' So, it's present but not deeply embedded, leading to a 2 rating."}
