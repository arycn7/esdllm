{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Transport Design module aligns with any of the provided SDGs: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at SDG 1: No Poverty. The module focuses on transport design, which could potentially impact poverty by providing better transportation options. But looking at the module content, it mainly deals with design projects, technical specs, and presentations. There's mention of considering environmental and social impacts, which might touch on poverty indirectly, but none of the learning objectives explicitly mention poverty reduction or empowerment. So maybe there's a slight connection, but not enough to meet two objectives. I'd say Embedding Status is No, with a rating of 1 because of limited reference.\n\nNext, SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Similar story here. The module doesn't directly address hunger or food security. It's about designing transport infrastructure, so unless transport directly ties into agricultural sustainability, which isn't covered here. Maybe a stretch, but no clear alignment. So Embedding Status: No, rating 0.\n\nThen, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. Transport can impact public health by reducing accidents or improving air quality. The module does consider environmental impacts, which could relate to health. Also, developing empathy for users might tie into well-being. So perhaps two objectives are met here. Thus, Embedding Status: Yes, with a rating of 2.\n\nLastly, SDG 4: Quality Education. The module is part of an educational program, aiming to develop engineering skills. It emphasizes applied learning and teamwork, which are aspects of quality education. Several learning objectives like applying knowledge, integrating skills, and presenting solutions align with providing quality education. So definitely meets two or more objectives. Therefore, Embedding Status: Yes, with a rating of 3.\n\nSo overall, SDG 3 and 4 are embedded, while 1 and 2 aren't."}
{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the Transport Design module aligns with four specific SDGs: 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 5: Gender Equality. The module focuses on transport design, so I need to see if any part of it touches on gender issues. The module mentions considering environmental and social impacts, which could include gender, but it's pretty vague. The learning objectives don't explicitly mention gender; they're more about applying engineering knowledge, integrating information, and presenting designs. So maybe there's a slight reference, but nothing concrete. I'd say limited evidence here.\n\nNext, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The module doesn't talk about water or sanitation directly. It's about transport infrastructure, so unless there's a component on water management in transport projects, which isn't mentioned, I don't see a link. So no evidence here either.\n\nMoving on to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. Again, the module is about transport design. While transport can relate to energy use, like electric trains, the module doesn't specify anything about energy sources or sustainability beyond general environmental impact. So again, it seems like there's minimal connection, maybe just a passing mention, but not enough to meet two objectives.\n\nLastly, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The module includes project-based learning and teamwork, which might touch on employment skills. However, the content doesn't address economic growth or decent work explicitly. It's more about design skills than economic aspects. So probably limited reference here too.\n\nOverall, none of these SDGs have more than limited references in the module. Most connections are indirect or too vague, so embedding ratings would be low."}
{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the Transport Design module aligns with the selected SDGs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The module focuses on designing transport infrastructure like a Light Rail Line. This seems relevant because transport infrastructure is a big part of industry and innovation. The module mentions considering environmental and social impacts, which ties into sustainable infrastructure goals. So, at least two learning objectives here seem covered, like understanding sustainable infrastructure and being able to argue for sustainable solutions. That means SDG 9 is partially embedded, maybe a rating of 2.\n\nNext, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. The module includes developing empathy for users and integrating social considerations. It requires assessing environmental and social impacts, which could relate to reducing inequalities by ensuring accessibility and fairness. However, the module doesn't explicitly address inequality reduction strategies or negotiation of rights. So, maybe only one objective is met here. Since we need at least two, SDG 10 might not be fully embedded. Maybe a rating of 1 or even 0 if it's too vague.\n\nThen, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The module is all about creating inclusive, safe, and resilient cities through transport design. It evaluates sustainability in areas like transport and accessibility, which directly relates to making cities more sustainable. Students learn to consider user needs and present solutions, which covers several objectives under SDG 11. Definitely, more than two are met, so this would be a full embed with a rating of 3.\n\nLastly, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The module emphasizes efficient design and environmental impact assessments. While it touches on production patterns indirectly through design choices, there's no explicit mention of sustainable consumption practices or reducing waste. So, maybe only one minor link here, leading to a limited reference, rating of 1.\n\nSo, compiling all this, SDG 9 and 11 are definitely embedded, with 10 and 12 having minimal or no direct links."}
{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Alright, I'm looking at the Transport Design module. It seems to focus on designing transport infrastructure like a Light Rail Line. Let me break down each SDG to see if they're covered.\n\nStarting with SDG 13: Climate Action. The module mentions considering environmental and social impacts during the design phase. That touches on objectives 4 and 6 from SDG 13, which are about understanding consequences and explaining ecosystem impacts. So, there's partial embeddedness here, maybe a rating of 2.\n\nNext, SDG 14: Life Below Water. The module doesn't talk about marine resources or oceans directly. It's more about transport on land, so I don't see any direct links. This would be a No with a rating of 0.\n\nMoving to SDG 15: Life on Land. The module does address environmental impacts and considers land use, which aligns with objectives 2 and 3 from SDG 15. That covers understanding local ecosystems and threats to biodiversity. So, partial embeddedness again, rating 2.\n\nFor SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. There's nothing in the module about justice or governance. So, another No with rating 0.\n\nLastly, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. The module involves teamwork and presentations, which could tie into partnerships, but it's not explicit. Maybe limited reference, so rating 1.\n\nSo, compiling all that, I'd say SDG 13 and 15 have partial embeddedness, while the others have none or limited references."}
{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "Competencies", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to analyze this Transport Design module against eight key competencies. Let me start by understanding what each competency entails and then see how they align with the module's content and objectives.\n\nFirst up is Systems Thinking. This competency is about recognizing relationships in complex systems, analyzing them, and dealing with uncertainty. Looking at the module, it mentions developing transport infrastructure like a light rail line, considering factors like demand, budget, environment, and social impacts. That definitely involves systems thinking because students have to consider how different components interact. They also handle uncertainties like limited info and changing design briefs. So yes, direct reference here, and since it's a core part, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext is Anticipatory Competency, which is about envisioning futures, assessing consequences, and handling risks. The module has students predict transport demand and future usage, appraise environmental and social impacts, and adapt to design changes. These activities require looking ahead and adjusting plans based on potential scenarios. Directly referenced, so embedding rating is 3 again.\n\nNormative Competency deals with values and sustainability, negotiating trade-offs. The module explicitly considers environmental and social impacts, budgets, and balances different stakeholder needs. So yes, direct references, and since it's integral, embedding is 3.\n\nStrategic Competency is about collective innovation for sustainability. While the module focuses on applying existing knowledge rather than creating new strategies, it does address sustainability through design. Maybe not as directly strategic, so embedding might be partial, rating 2.\n\nCollaboration Competency involves teamwork, empathy, and conflict resolution. The module includes team work, requires empathy for users, and managing group dynamics. Direct references are clear, so embedding is 3.\n\nCritical Thinking means questioning norms and reflecting on values. The module makes students critique designs and reflect on their approaches. It's present throughout, so embedding is 3.\n\nSelf-AwareNESS is about personal reflection and societal role. The module doesn't specifically mention self-reflection beyond design tasks, so maybe indirect. I'll say embedding is 2.\n\nIntegrated Problem-Solving combines various frameworks for complex issues. The module uses multi-disciplinary approaches and handles complex, ill-defined problems. Definitely embedded, so rating is 3.\n\nSo overall, each competency is well-addressed, mostly fully embedded except for Strategic and Self-awareness, which are partially covered."}
{"source_file": "3T. Core CE7T05.pdf", "section": "Pedagogy", "think_content": "Alright, let's break down how I analyzed the module for each pedagogical approach.\n\nFirst, for **Learner-Centred** approach, the module mentions students working individually and in teams, developing their own solutions. This shows autonomy, which aligns with learner-centered methods. So, direct reference is yes, and since it's a core part of the module, I rated it a 3.\n\nNext, looking at **Action-OrientED**, the module uses project-based learning with real-world applications. Students go through design phases, reflecting and applying what they've learned. This mirrors Kolb's experiential cycle, so direct reference is yes. It's heavily embedded, so another 3.\n\nLastly, for **Transformative** approaches, while the module does challenge students with real issues and design changes, it doesn't explicitly mention empowerment or changing worldviews. So, no direct reference here, embedding rating is 0."}
