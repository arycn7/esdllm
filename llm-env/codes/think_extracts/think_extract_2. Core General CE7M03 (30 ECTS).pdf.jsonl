{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Trinity College Dublin Dissertation module aligns with any of the provided SDGs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at SDG 1: No Poverty. The module is about students doing individual research projects in engineering. Hmm, does this relate to poverty?Well, the module's learning objectives don't explicitly mention poverty or its reduction. They focus more on research skills, literature review, applying theories, etc. So maybe there's no direct link here. Unless the research topics somehow tie into poverty, but the module doesn't specify that. So probably, SDG 1 isn't embedded here.\n\nNext, SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Similar story. The module is about engineering research, not directly about hunger or agriculture. Unless a student chooses a topic related to sustainable agriculture, but again, the module doesn't require that. So likely, SDG 2 isn't embedded either.\n\nNow, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. The module involves conducting health-related research? Not necessarily. It's broader engineering, so unless health topics are chosen, it might not align. But since the module allows any engineering topic, some could relate to health. However, the module itself doesn't emphasize health outcomes, so embedding is limited. Maybe a rating of 1 if any health topics are covered, but not sure.\n\nLastly, SDG 4: Quality Education. This seems more aligned because the module is part of academic education. It promotes research and critical thinking, which are part of quality education. Also, the graduate attributes like communicating effectively and thinking independently support education goals. So SDG 4 is definitely embedded here, perhaps with a higher rating like 2 or 3.\n\nWait, but looking back, the module's content is more about research methodology than education itself. So maybe the alignment with SDG 4 is partial, not full. So maybe a rating of 2.\n\nSo, compiling this, SDG 1, 2, and 3 aren't embedded, but SDG 4 is partially embedded."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7M03 aligns with four specific SDGs: 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with SDG 5: Gender Equality. The module is about a dissertation where students pick a research topic in engineering. Looking at the learning objectives, I don't see anything directly mentioning gender issues or equality. They focus more on research skills, data analysis, and presenting findings. So maybe no direct link here. Maybe some indirect if students choose a gender-related topic, but the module doesn't require it. So probably no embedding for SDG 5.\n\nNext, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The module involves engineering research, so if a student picks a water-related topic, they might address this SDG. But again, the module doesn't specify that students must choose such topics. It's optional. So unless the module requires it, there's limited evidence. Hence, embedding status might be limited or none.\n\nMoving to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. Similar to SDG 6, if a student chooses an energy-related topic, they could align with this goal. But since the module doesn't enforce this choice, it's not guaranteed. So embedding would be limited unless the module explicitly includes energy topics, which it doesn't seem to.\n\nLastly, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The module focuses on individual research projects without specific mention of economic growth or employment issues. Unless a student's research is on this area, there's no direct connection. So embedding here is unlikely.\n\nSo, after evaluating each SDG, it seems that none of them are explicitly embedded in the module content. Students can choose topics related to these SDGs, but it's not required. Therefore, the embedding is either limited or absent."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the module CE7M03 aligns with the provided SDGs. Let me go through each SDG one by one.\n\nStarting with SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The module involves a research dissertation where students pick a topic related to engineering. Since engineering often ties into industry and infrastructure, I can see some connection here. For example, students might research sustainable infrastructure or innovative materials. Looking at the learning objectives, LO1 mentions contributing to scientific/technological knowledge, which directly relates to industry and innovation. LO3 talks about applying research tools to solve complex engineering problems, which could involve industrial applications. So, at least two objectives seem covered here. I'd rate this as a 2 because it's partially embedded but not fully integrated throughout the entire module.\n\nMoving on to SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. The module doesn't explicitly mention anything about inequality or social justice. It's focused more on research methods and technical skills rather than social issues. So, no direct link here. Embedding status would be No with a rating of 0.\n\nNext, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Engineering research could touch on urban planning or sustainable city developments. For instance, if a student chooses a topic on green infrastructure or smart cities, that connects. However, the module itself doesn't specify this focus. Some learning objectives like LO6 about modeling systems could relate to city planning. But without explicit mention, it's limited. Maybe a rating of 1 since there's a slight reference but not much depth.\n\nLastly, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The module emphasizes research and innovation, which could tie into sustainable production methods. However, again, unless the research topic is specifically about sustainability, it's not clear. There's a small chance, so maybe a limited reference, rating 1.\n\nOverall, only SDG 9 shows partial embedding, while the others have minimal or no evidence."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to align this module called \"Dissertation\" from Trinity College Dublin with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The user has given me four SDGs to look at: 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Wait, actually looking back, the SDGs listed are 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17. So five SDGs in total. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each SDG is about. Let me list them again:\n\n- SDG 13: Climate Action\n- SDG 14: Life Below Water \n- SDG 15: Life on Land \n- SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions \n- SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals \n\nEach of these has specific learning objectives, and I have to see if at least two of these objectives are reflected in the module content. If yes, then rate the embedding as 1, 2, or 3, where 3 means fully embedded.\n\nLooking at the module content, it's a dissertation module where students pick a research topic in their specialization, conduct research under supervision, and produce a dissertation. The learning objectives focus on contributing to scientific/technological knowledge, applying research tools, solving complex engineering problems, conducting experiments, modeling systems, evaluating findings, writing professionally, presenting results.\n\nNow, let's go through each SDG one by one.\n\nStarting with SDG 13: Climate Action. Its learning objectives include understanding the greenhouse effect, current climate change causes, human contributions to climate change, consequences, strategies for prevention/mitigation/adaptation, explaining ecosystem dynamics, encouraging others to protect the climate, collaborating on strategies, personal impact assessment, evaluating job activities' climate friendliness, acting for people threatened by climate change, anticipating impacts of decisions, promoting climate-protecting policies, supporting climate-friendly economics.\n\nLooking at the module, does it cover any of these? The module is about engineering research. If a student chooses a climate-related topic, like renewable energy or carbon sequestration, then maybe some of these objectives would be met. But since the module doesn't't specify that students must choose climate topics, it's optional. Therefore, unless the module explicitly requires it, it might not necessarily address SDG13. So, without explicit mention, it's hard to say it meets two learning objectives. Maybe if a student picks a relevant topic, but the module itself isn't structured to ensure that. So perhaps Embedding Status is No.\n\nNext, SDG14: Life Below Water. It focuses on marine ecology, threats like pollution and overfishing, sustainable use of resources, arguing for sustainable fishing, showing humanity's impact on oceans, influencing unsustainable practices, reflecting on diet, empathizing with affected livelihoods, debating fishing methods, identifying sustainable products, contacting reps about overfishing, campaigning for marine reserves.\n\nAgain, the module is general engineering research. Unless a student selects an ocean-related topic, the module content doesn't specifically target these objectives. So similar to SDG13, unless the topic is chosen, it's not embedded. Thus, Embedding Status likely No.\n\nMoving to SDG15: Life on Land. It deals with ecology, biodiversity threats, conservation strategies, arguing against destructive practices, connecting with nature, creating visions for harmony with nature, working with policymakers, highlighting soil importance, campaigning for species protection.\n\nThe module allows students to pick topics in their specialization, which could include environmental engineering, but again, unless specified, it's not guaranteed. So unless a student chooses a land-related topic, the module doesn't inherently meet these objectives. Hence, Embedding Status probably No.\n\nThen SDG16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Focuses on justice, legislative systems, comparing justice systems, individuals' roles in upholding justice, human rights framework, debating issues, showing empathy, reflecting on personal roles, critically assessing issues, demanding policies, collaborating with unjust groups, becoming change agents, contributing to conflict resolution.\n\nThe module is about independent research, which could touch on justice if the topic is selected, but otherwise, it doesn't directly address these objectives. So unless the topic is chosen, it's not covered. Therefore, Embedding Status likely No.\n\nLastly, SDG17: Partnerships for the Goals. Involves global issues, multi-stakeholder partnerships, global governance, cooperation on science and tech, measuring progress, raising awareness on partnerships, promoting partnerships, taking ownership of SDGs, creating visions, experiencing global belonging, becoming change agents, contributing to local-national-global partnerships, supporting development cooperation, influencing companies.\n\nThe module emphasizes research and presentation skills, which could involve partnerships if the topic is chosen, but without specific direction, it's not assured. So unless the topic aligns with partnerships, it's not embedded. Thus, Embedding Status probably No.\n\nSo, after reviewing each SDG, none of them have at least two learning objectives clearly embedded in the module content because the module is too broad and doesn't force specific SDG-aligned topics. Therefore, all SDGs would have an Embedding Status of No, with an Embedding Rating of 0."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Competencies", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to analyze the CE7M03 Dissertation module against eight competencies. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, Systems Thinking. The module involves conducting individual research projects, which might involve analyzing complex systems. Students have to plan, execute, and report on their projects, which includes dealing with uncertainties like in research. So, yes, there's a direct reference here. Since it's a major part of the module, I'd rate the embedding as 3.\n\nNext, Anticipatory Competency. This is about understanding multiple futures and creating visions. Looking at the learning objectives, LO2 mentions synthesizing literature on unfamiliar problems, and LO3 talks about applying tools for innovative solutions. While not directly stating futures, the research inherently requires anticipating outcomes and impacts. So, indirect reference. Maybe a 2 for embedding.\n\nNormative Competency deals with norms and values. The module doesn't explicitly mention reflecting on norms or negotiating values. However, LO7 involves critically evaluating research findings and their implications, which touches on norms indirectly. So, some indirect reference but limited. I'll give it a 1.\n\nStrategic Competency is about developing innovative actions for sustainability. The module focuses on individual projects rather than collective strategies. There's no direct mention of strategic actions or implementing plans together. So, no evidence here. Rating is 0.\n\nCollaboration Competency involves empathy and group problem-solving. The module is mostly individual work, though LO9 mentions presenting to peers and responding to questions. That's a bit of collaboration, so indirect reference. Not a strong focus, so embedding rating is 1.\n\nCritical Thinking is about questioning norms and reflecting on values. LO2 asks to assess and synthesize literature, LO7 involves critical evaluation of findings. These are direct references to critical thinking. Since it's a core part of research, embedding is definitely 3.\n\nSelf-AwareNESS is reflecting on one's role in society. The module doesn't specifically address personal reflection beyond LO7's self-assessment of research strengths. It's more implicit, so indirect. Maybe a 2.\n\nIntegrated Problem-Solving combines various frameworks for complex issues. The module has students apply different tools and techniques across LOs, especially LO3 and LO4. They design experiments and analyze data, which integrates problem-solving approaches. Direct reference here, so embedding rating is 3."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M03 (30 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Pedagogy", "think_content": "Alright, let's break down how I analyzed the module for each pedagogical approach.\n\nFirst, **Learner-Centred Approach**: The module clearly mentions students proposing their own research topics and working autonomously with supervisors. This shows trust in students' ability to take charge of their learning, fitting the learner-centered method. So, direct reference is yes, and since it's heavily integrated throughout the module, embedding rating is 3.\n\nNext, **Action-Oriented Learning**: The module involves hands-on research projects, practical application of tools, and real-world problem solving. These elements align perfectly with action-oriented learning, especially since students go through cycles of planning, executing, and reflecting. Direct reference isn't explicitly mentioned, but the structure strongly supports it, so embedding rating is 2.\n\nLastly, **Transformative Learning**: While the module encourages critical evaluation and reflection, it doesn't explicitly aim to change students' worldviews or challenge their perspectives beyond their current understanding. There's no direct mention of transformative goals, so embedding rating is limited, just a 1.\n\nOverall, the module uses a mix of learner-centered and action-oriented approaches, with some minor elements of transformative learning."}
