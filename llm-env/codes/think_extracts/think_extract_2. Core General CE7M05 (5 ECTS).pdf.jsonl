{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Alright, let me break down how I analyzed each SDG against the module content.\n\nStarting with SDG 1: No Poverty. Looking at the module's content, which focuses on research methods, I don't see any direct links to understanding poverty concepts, causes, or strategies. The module doesn't cover social issues like poverty reduction or empowerment, so it doesn't meet the required two objectives. Therefore, Embedding Status is No and Rating is 0.\n\nMoving to SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Similar to SDG 1, the module doesn't address hunger, malnutrition, or sustainable agriculture. It's centered around research processes and methods without touching on these specific areas. So again, no alignment here; Embedding Status is No, Rating 0.\n\nNext, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. The module does mention health-related topics indirectly through research ethics and data analysis, but it lacks depth on mental health, disease prevention, or well-being promotion. Only minimal references, so Embedding Status is Yes, but with limited touchpoints; Rating is 1.\n\nNow, SDG 4: Quality Education. The module strongly aligns here. It covers critical thinking, research planning, and communication skills, all of which are crucial for quality education. Students learn to appraise existing research and design proposals, which ties into lifelong learning and equitable education. Multiple learning objectives match, so Embedding Status is Yes with strong alignment; Rating is 3.\n\nSo, compiling all this, the JSON reflects each SDG's presence in the module."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the Research Methods module aligns with four specific SDGs: 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 5: Gender Equality. The module content includes things like research ethics, which might touch on issues like plagiarism and confidentiality. But does it specifically address gender equality?The learning objectives mention recognizing ethical issues but don't explicitly mention gender-related topics. So maybe there's no direct link here. It seems like the module doesn't cover gender equality objectives, so Embedding Status would be No with a rating of 0.\n\nNext, SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The module talks about data collection, analysis, and report writing. These could relate to water management research, but again, nothing explicit about water or sanitation is mentioned. Unless research strategies implicitly cover water topics, but without clear evidence, I'd say it's Not embedded either. So another No with a 0 rating.\n\nMoving on to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. The module covers research strategies and data analysis, which could be applied to energy studies. However, the content doesn't specify anything about energy resources or sustainability. So unless the research is explicitly about energy, which it isn't, this SDG isn't directly addressed. Thus, Embedding Status is No, rating 0.\n\nLastly, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The module focuses on managing research projects and communicating results. While it touches on labor rights through ethics, there's no specific mention of employment or economic growth. So again, no direct alignment here. Embedding Status is No, rating 0.\n\nSo overall, none of these SDGs are embedded in the module. Each gets a No with a 0 rating."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the Research Methods module aligns with the four specified SDGs: 9, 10, 11, and 12. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. The module teaches research methodologies, including ethics and data analysis. Looking at the learning objectives, students learn about managing research projects and ethical issues like plagiarism and data protection. These relate to sustainable infrastructure because they touch on responsible practices and innovation in research, which can tie into industry advancements. So, maybe two learning objectives here are covered.\n\nNext, SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. The module includes recognizing ethical issues and communicating research. While it doesn't directly address inequality reduction, the focus on ethical research might indirectly support fairness and transparency, which are part of reducing inequalities. But does this cover at least two learning objectives? It seems limited, so perhaps only one is met.\n\nThen, SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The module covers aspects like data analysis and report writing, which could relate to evaluating city sustainability. However, the module doesn't explicitly mention urban planning or community development, so maybe no direct alignment here.\n\nLastly, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The module discusses research strategies and ethical considerations, which might relate to sustainable production practices. Students learn to identify ethical issues, which could tie into responsible consumption. Again, this seems indirect but present enough for partial embedding.\n\nSo, summarizing: SDG 9 has some alignment through research ethics and management. SDG 10 has minimal overlap. SDG 11 doesn't seem to align much. SDG 12 has a bit through ethics and strategy discussions. Therefore, only SDG 9 would have a higher embedding rating, while the others might be lower or none."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "sdg_analysis", "think_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the Research Methods module aligns with any of the provided SDGs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at SDG 13: Climate Action. The module talks about research ethics, data collection, and report writing. Hmm, does that cover anything about climate change? Not directly. It seems more about academic research skills rather than specific climate topics. So maybe no embedding here.\n\nNext, SDG 14: Life Below Water. The module includes stuff like data analysis and software tools but nothing specific about marine ecosystems or ocean conservation. So probably no direct link here either.\n\nNow, SDG 15: Life on Land. Again, the module focuses on research processes and doesn't mention terrestrial ecosystems or biodiversity. So likely no embedding for this one too.\n\nMoving on to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The module touches on ethical issues and report communication but doesn't delve into justice systems or peace promotion. So no match here as well.\n\nLastly, SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. The module is about research collaboration and global issues but doesn't specifically address partnerships for development goals. So no embedding here.\n\nSo overall, none of these SDGs seem to be embedded in the module content. Each SDG requires at least two learning objectives to be met, but the module doesn't cover any of those aspects explicitly. Therefore, all SDGs have No Evidence of embedding."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Competencies", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to analyze the Research Methods module against eight competencies. Let me start by understanding what each competency entails and then see how they align with the module content and learning objectives.\n\nFirst, Systems Thinking. It's about recognizing relationships in complex systems and dealing with uncertainty. Looking at the module, it covers research processes, data collection, and analysis. Students learn to plan projects and critically appraise methods. This seems related because research involves understanding how different components interact, like literature review informing the research design. So, yes, there are direct references here, and the embedding is probably around 2 since it's part of the process but not the main focus.\n\nNext, Anticipatory Competency. This is about envisioning futures and assessing consequences. The module helps students identify future research scopes and design proposals. They also learn to anticipate issues like plagiarism and data protection. That directly ties into anticipating future issues, so yes, and maybe a 2 for embedding since it's part of planning and ethical considerations.\n\nNormative Competency deals with values and sustainability. The module touches on ethical issues, plagiarism, and confidentiality. Students have to recognize these norms, which is a direct reference. However, it's a smaller part of the module, so embedding might be a 1.\n\nStrategic Competency is about developing innovative actions for sustainability. The module focuses more on individual research skills rather than collective strategic actions. There's no direct mention of sustainability initiatives, so embedding rating would be 0.\n\nCollaboration Competency involves working with others and empathy. The module doesn't explicitly mention group work or collaboration beyond literature reviews. So, no direct references, embedding is 0.\n\nCritical Thinking is about questioning norms and reflecting on values. The module requires critical appraisal of research methods and tools, which is a direct reference. Since it's a significant part of the learning objectives, embedding is probably a 3.\n\nSelf-AwareNESS is about reflecting on one's role in society. The module doesn't specifically address personal reflection or societal roles beyond ethical issues. So, no direct references, embedding is 0.\n\nIntegrated Problem-Solving involves applying various frameworks to complex problems. The module teaches research strategies and data analysis, which are parts of problem-solving. Directly referenced through the research process, so embedding is a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each competency is evaluated based on whether the module content and objectives directly or indirectly support them, assigning ratings accordingly."}
{"source_file": "2. Core General CE7M05 (5 ECTS).pdf", "section": "Pedagogy", "think_content": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the pedagogical approaches mentioned in the module content and see how embedded they are. Let me start by looking at each approach one by one.\n\nFirst up is Learner-Centred Approach. The module talks about students planning and managing their own projects, like the research proposals and experiments. That sounds like they're taking charge of their learning, which fits with learner-centered ideas. So direct reference here? Yeah, because the module explicitly mentions a learner-centred pedagogy. Now, how embedded is it? They have assessments like the ethics report and literature review, which require independent work. So maybe a high embedding, like 3.\n\nNext is Action-Oriented Learning. The module includes things like designing experiments and conducting data analysis. These are hands-on activities, aligning with action learning's focus on practical experience. Directly mentioned? Yes, since action-oriented is part of the pedagogical approaches described. How embedded? The module uses real-life applications through projects and reports, so embedding is probably a 3 too.\n\nLastly, Transformative Learning. The module doesn't seem to emphasize changing worldviews or disruptive thinking. It focuses more on practical skills. So no direct reference here. Therefore, embedding rating would be 0.\n\nSo compiling these thoughts into the required JSON format."}
